# Introduction 

The facerecognition app is a Full-Stack app created with Javascrit, React, nodejs, Express, Postgresql.

The app only need a url of a picture and it will recognize a face in the picture and show a blu square in aroudn it using machine learning provided by the clarify api.

## Started Guide 

Deploying the project is very simple download it and run the npm command to install all the dependecies.

```
  npm install
```

## The Backend 

### login 

the backend is able to hanlde login and routing using state in the front-end and knox in the backend for database trnasaction between node and postgersql

The Backend does not need to be deploy is already running on heroku so is very easy for you to get the project running is you need to know how the backend was build 
here is a link to the server side code that was use for this project [Facerecognition Server Code](https://github.com/fernandoapeguero/smart-brain-server)


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
